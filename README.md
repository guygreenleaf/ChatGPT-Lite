# chatgpt-lite README

A VS Code Extension to use both the free-tier and paid-tier ChatGPT. No data mining or collection, no BS, just ChatGPT like you'd expect.

## Features

Use free-tier ChatGPT - In Progress
Use paid-tier ChatGPT with more customizable options - In Progress

## Requirements

This is a VSCode extension, so of course this requires a working version of VSCode.  This project renders a React app created and built with Vite inside a VSCode sidepanel.  NPM is the package manager being used for both the extension itself and the React app.
